Personal CV/Resume About Me Website

Using this repo to wrap my head around the file structure issues work has had using git in the past.
It served as some local, consequence-free testing, and now I have both identified our issue(s) and 
feel way more confident in my git knowledge.

I'm feeling more confident in branches and how this whole thing works, but still may be lacking when it comes to how the HEAD works. I'm making this edit, and then switching branches.

Turns out, if the branch you switch to doesn't have the file you've put in the working tree, it'll cause problems. That makes sense now that I think about it. I'll commit this, and make another branch for testing.

Adding this message and switching branches again.

Hmm, that still didn't work as I expected. Oh well, I think I'll have to read about detached HEADs some more.
